**Arun is a scientist and musician.** He is interested in how music moves people. His research combines systems neuroscience, music cognition, and affective science to understand how a predictive brain makes meaning from ordered sound. Specifically, he is interested in the role of interoception--a brain's inference and control over a body--in musical pleasure.

Currently, Arun is pursuing a PhD at Northeastern University in the Music Image and Neural Dynamics lab working with Dr. Psyche Loui. He completed a Bachelor's of Arts in violin performance at the New England Conservatory with Prof. Nicholas Kitchen, and has been playing violin for over two decades. His past work has combined live music with neuroimaging to investigate the impact of music performance on brain dynamics.
