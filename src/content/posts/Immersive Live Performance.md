I am interested in how

I wrote and won the Entrepreneurial Musicianship grant at NEC in 2024 and began to foster an interdisciplinary collaboration between the MIND Lab and the music conservatory. I worked with Dr. Psyche Loui to design and conduct the experiment. I worked with world-renowned violinist [Joshua Brown](https://www.joshuabrownviolinist.com/), who gave around 50 live performances for my participants. We conducted the experiment at Pierce Hall at the New England Conservatory. I fondly (not so fondly) remember carrying our speaker system and EEG system back and forth from the MIND Lab to Pierce Hall for each participant session. Thank you to all the people behind the scenes---friends, family, administration :smile:---who helped make it happen.

This is an [article](https://necmusic.edu/about/news/how-an-nec-violin-student-used-cutting-edge-neuroscience-to-understand-the-unspoken-connection-between-performer-and-audience/) that NEC wrote about the study.

This is our [pre-print](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40236171/) of the research article, which is currently in review. 

Here are some more fun pictures:
